                    <h3>Lecture Content and Reflection</h3>

                    <h4>Film and Animation Production Cycle</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pre-production: director doing script, treatment</li>
						<li>Production: shot, storyboard</li>
						<li>Post-production: editing, music</li>
						<li>Back in before, the composer usually joined in the post-production process. Most of the thing has been down, they need to add music for the film.</li>
						<li>Nowadays, the composer usually going to be involved in a much earlier stage. Sometimes, the director even asks the composer to write something based on the script.</li>
						<li>The director and editor would use temp music to get the feeling of cutting scenes.</li>
						<li>The earlier composers came in, they would get more of their own sound. Editors and directors do not need to use temp music any more.</li>
						<li>ADR - Re-record of dialogue.</li>
                    </ul>

					<h4>Diegetic and non-diegetic music</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Diegetic music - Music can be heard in the film, what actually happened in the film, what the character can hear</li>
						<li>Non-diegetic music - film music the character cannot hear, scored music</li>
                    </ul>

					<h4>Film Music History - 1927 to 1945</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Between 1930-1933 the majority of mainstream Hollywood films adhered to strict rules of diegetic music only accompanying film.</li>
						<li>The Blue Angel 1930:
							<ul>
								<li>Heavy music was used in the opening but immediately stopped when the film started. All the scene later on is diegetic sound only.</li>
								<li>The whistle sound from the character and the ringing sound from the bell increase the entertainment of this no-score music film.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						<li>King kong 1933
							<ul>
								<li>There is a page with ‘OVERTURE’ at the start of the film for quite a long time with the music, followed by some instructions, just like what happens to the opera or stage show. The overture gives audiences a basic idea of this film's overall mood and emotion.</li>
								<li>The music gradually faded out when the actual film came in as well.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
                    </ul>
