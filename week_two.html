                    <h3>Lecture Content and Reflection</h3>

                    <h4>Assignment 1 Introduction</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How many minutes is the music used in the film? Percentage? Was there some silence?</li>
                        <li>What are the different approaches used in the film?</li>
                        <li>Need to discuss both films and do some comparisons.</li>
						<li>What is the inspiration for music (aesthetic, arrangement, creative choices)?</li>
						<li>Discuss the positive and negative in both of the films.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Elements of music</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Melody: ways of creating a theme, any collection of notes, something you can harm
                            <ul>
                                <li>Melody can be consonant (notes in the harmony) or dissonant (notes sound weird)</li>
								<li>Some composers like to have their own theme and their own sound. Nowadays, most composers all sound the same → commercial sound.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Rhythm: sense of propulsion and syncopation (off-beat), give the pace of music and film</li>
						<li>Harmony: chords support the melody → chord progression</li>
						<li>Tempo: the speed of music, would be different according to what happens in the scene</li>
						<li>Form: Different sections of the music, not some key things need to focus on film music</li>
						<li>Dynamics: how loud/quiet the music, really important for the film music (the best way is to do some volume automation on the track while watching the film)</li>
						<li>Timbre: instrumentation was used for the arrangement of the music</li>
						<li>Texture: how many layers you have in the music</li>
						<li>The most important thing for film music is what does the right thing for the scene instead of focusing on the rule</li>
                    </ul>

					<h4>Interstellar</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The dynamics and texture change over the storyline. As the story develops, the music is gradually getting louder, more instruments and layers are added in.</li>
						<li>A theme can be heard from the cut scene. There is a basic pattern but lots of variation happens according to what’s on the screen.</li>
						<li>Most of the notes used are within the harmony. However, some of the dissonance was used to make the audience feel nervous.</li>
						<li>A Long note was used for the ending of a section of the music.</li>
						<li>The use of silence followed by a loud noise makes a powerful contrast, force the audience to focus on what happened on the screen.</li>
                    </ul>
