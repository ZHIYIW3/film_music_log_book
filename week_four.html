                    <h3>Lecture Content and Reflection</h3>

                    <h4>King Kong</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Can listen to both score and dialogue, use both diegetic and non-diegetic music.</li>
						<li>This is when the score becomes important to talk the story.</li>
						<li>The initial 20 minutes of the film have no underscore, and the remainder of the film is full of score music./li>
						<li>Music sets the tone of the film</li>
						<li>The framework of diegetic and non-diegetic music was finally established and remains in use today.</li>
						<li>Now music is synchronized to the editing of the film - music is pre-composed.</li>
						
						<li>Personal thinking
							<ul>
								<li>The music is almost there for the entire section played in class, it gets softer when the dialogue joins in and louder again when there is only music</li>
								<li>The composer tries to create tension by increasing the tempo, layers and volume of the music.</li>
								<li>Good use of sudden silence - drag the audience’s attention to the frame.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						<li>Four different sections with music changes
							<ul>
								<li>Start with the arc - create the mystery</li>
								<li>Brass comes in and slowly gets more tense.</li>
								<li>Walking towards the tribes - music becomes more rhythmic with strings, faster.</li>
								<li>This music stops following the man’s yelling.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						<li>As the man walks down, the music follows each step - almost like a music sound effect</li>
                    </ul>

					<h4>Glossary</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Diegetic music - Music can be heard in the film, what actually happened in the film, what the character can hear</li>
						<li>Non-diegetic music - film music the character cannot hear, scored music</li>
						<li>Click Track - use of metronome marking in film music, use it as a guide of how fast the music should be, helps to understand the pace of the music</li>
						<li>Punches - used to create a single hole in film stock that when run through a projector creates a flash of light and a ‘pop’ sound -> a visual/guide for conductor</li>
						<li>Streamers - diagonal scratch cut directly into film stock -> create a line that moves across the screen used as a visual guide for conductor</li>

						<li>Temp Track -  music used by editor/director as a guide to musical type, style, sound or feel intended for original music that will later replace the temp
							<ul>
								<li>The director sometimes can get really attached to the temp score, they would want a similar style to the temp track</li>
								<li>Hard for a composer to have their own style, everything sounds similar</li>
								<li>Temp track happens for most of the large production movie</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						<li>Leitmotif - A single short musical motive that is linked to a character, place or event</li>
                    </ul>

					<h4>Jaws (Diegetic and Non-diegetic music)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When the screen shows people playing and talking on the beach comfortably, it uses all diegetic music, shows the great atmosphere</li>
						<li>When the camera shifts under the sea, the music also shart to shift to non-diegetic, giving the audience a mystery feeling of the unknown in the sea, building up the nervous feeling, and tension is start to rise here</li>
                    </ul>

					<h3>Compare and Analyse Flim Music Task</h3>

					<h4>Frankenstein - 1931 Notes</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Strong, heavy use of music in the start scene, using different wind instruments</li>
						<li>The music suddenly ends when the film starts, using diegetic sound (speak, bell and cry)</li>
						<li>Bell sound continuous for the first 2 minutes of the film</li>
						<li>The diagonal in the scene when two men looking at a suspended person can hear a high reverb with wide space voice -> shows the environment that is at and magnifies their nervous emotion</li>
						<li>Since there is no music, all use diegetic sound, the rain, wind, and thunder sound was used as a background sound and even sometimes cover over the diagonal.</li>
						<li>When the machine is turned on, lots of sounds with different pitches are played.</li>
						<li>A large noise followed by the diagonal “Don’t touch that!” in 20:52 suddenly pulls the audience to a nervous.</li>
						<li>At 22.59, a continuous noise is going on to lead the audience to the character’s emotions, thinking and guessing what happened to the ‘experiment’ on the bed. The noise gradually comes down when the bed drops down.</li>
						<li>Machine noise is the method they use here to express these moods when only diegetic sounds are used.</li>
						<li>Most of the calm diagonals do not have any music or other sounds going on, letting the audience focus on the diagonals.</li>
						<li>Footstep noise is used at 33:57 to portray the monster fighting with people.</li>
						<li>No music at 36:20 when the monster tries to get out of the door -> explore the feeling</li>
						<li>A fast bell sound is used in weddings.</li>
						<li>When the camera moves to the street with lots of people dancing, it is the first time music is used inside the film, it is still the diegetic sound -> dancing music, and can see people playing instruments (violin)</li>
						<li>When the screen converts to the monster, the music suddenly ends, and the silence makes a construct provides a horror atmosphere</li>
						<li>When the scene changes back to dancing, the music comes back again -> contrast</li>
						<li>In the wedding/when they talk inside the building, the dancing music can be heard very softly as a background</li>
						<li>In the scene when the monster fights with Frankenstein, the crown and dog noise is used to create the atmosphere.</li>
						<li>The heavy music comes again in the end scene.</li>
					</ul>
