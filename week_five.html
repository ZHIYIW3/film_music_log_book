                    <h3>Lecture Content and Reflection</h3>

                    <h4>Reaper</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Marker
							<ul>
								<li>Note when the music needs a shift/change/build-up/fade in-out/important scene</li>
								<li>Right-click on timeline -> Insert marker -> Name marker</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						<li>Zoom in/out - +/- button on bottom right</li>
						<li>Show/Hide grid - little line button on the left top</li>
						<li>Solo a track - ‘s’ button on the left on the track</li>
						<li>Rename track - double click on the name of the track</li>
						<li>Every time you edit the project, save it as a new project -> can easily go back</li>
						<li>Adjust volume - Trim -> Volume -> Adjust the volume line</li>
						<li>Auto volume control - Volume trim -> right click -> insert point -> drag the volume line</li>
						<li>Don’t want peaking to happen -> the volume fader goes red (look carefully on master track)</li>
						<li>Create fade in/out by dragging from the top corner of the audio track</li>
						<li>Open VLC with Reaper -> Import video -> View -> Video</li>
                    </ul>

					<h4>Alexander Nevsky</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Scene 1 (21:50-24:30) -> The music has a main theme, it keeps moving up and down to showcase the nervous atmosphere. There is no diagonal, but can feel the characters’ thoughts from the music.</li>
						<li>Scene 2 (1:04:40 - 1:07:15) -> The music has lots of different layers to try to show the battle. However, the jocular tone and bright melody create a ridiculous environment instead of magnifying the intensity of the war.</li>
                    </ul>

					<h4>Laura 1944 Noir film - David Raksin</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The composer uses one central theme to score the entire film.</li>
						<li>The beginning of the film has really slow jazz music, it plays as the background that aesthetically lines the image.</li>
						<li>Compared to the other film at that time, the volume and texture of the music is really nice. It sets off what happens on the screen perfectly, and does not affect the diagonal that helps the audience immerse inside the story.</li>
                    </ul>

					<h4>Glossary</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spotting Session - watching a film or animation to decide where music will and won’t be included</li>
						<li>Timecode - exact momentin timme within a film or animation. Expressed in hours:Minutes:seconds:frames - 01:00:00:00</li>
						<li>Soft In/out - When music fades in/out gently</li>
						<li>Hard in/out - When music fades in/out loudly</li>
						<li>Hit Point - single moment in the timeline of a film or animation. Hit points are markers in time that can be later used to map out the structure of a musical cue, be it the start or end of a cue or significant moments within a music cue that could be emphasised</li>
						<li>Soft Hit - when a hit point is emphasised or caught in the music but does not need to occur on the exact frame or moment in picture. Soft hits are often shifts or changes in music that happen slightly after the hit point.</li>
						<li>Hard Hit - When a hit point is to be emphasised at the exact frame or moment in picture. Hard hits refer to a shift of change in music synched to an exact moment in time. The change in music itself may be loud or soft in nature.</li>
						<li>Sting - A dramatic moment on screen emphasised with a loud music accent.</li>
                    </ul>

					<h3>Compare and Analyse Flim Music Task</h3>

					<h4>Lady Frankenstein - 1971 Notes</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Strong, heavy use of music in the start scene, using different wind instruments</li>
						<li>The music suddenly ends when the film starts, using diegetic sound (speak, bell and cry)</li>
						<li>Bell sound continuous for the first 2 minutes of the film</li>
						<li>The diagonal in the scene when two men looking at a suspended person can hear a high reverb with wide space voice - shows the environment that is at and magnifies their nervous emotion</li>
						<li>Since there is no music, all use diegetic sound, the rain, wind, and thunder sound was used as a background sound and even sometimes cover over the diagonal.</li>
						<li>When the machine is turned on, lots of sounds with different pitches are played.</li>
						<li>A large noise followed by the diagonal “Don’t touch that!” in 20:52 suddenly pulls the audience to a nervous.</li>
						<li>At 22.59, a continuous noise is going on to lead the audience to the character’s emotions, thinking and guessing what happened to the ‘experiment’ on the bed. The noise gradually comes down when the bed drops down.</li>
						<li>Machine noise is the method they use here to express these moods when only diegetic sounds are used.</li>
						<li>Most of the calm diagonals do not have any music or other sounds going on, letting the audience focus on the diagonals.</li>
						<li>Footstep noise is used at 33:57 to portray the monster fighting with people.</li>
						<li>No music at 36:20 when the monster tries to get out of the door - explore the feeling</li>
						<li>A fast bell sound is used in weddings.</li>
						<li>When the camera moves to the street with lots of people dancing, it is the first time music is used inside the film, it is still the diegetic sound - dancing music, and can see people playing instruments (violin)</li>
						<li>When the screen converts to the monster, the music suddenly ends, and the silence makes a construct provides a horror atmosphere</li>
						<li>When the scene changes back to dancing, the music comes back again - contrast</li>
						<li>In the wedding/when they talk inside the building, the dancing music can be heard very softly as a background</li>
						<li>In the scene when the monster fights with Frankenstein, the crown and dog noise is used to create the atmosphere.</li>
						<li>The heavy music comes again in the end scene.</li>
