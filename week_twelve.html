                    <h4>Tempo Maps</h4>
                    <ul>
						<li>Sometimes the tempo will change in a scene according to the storyline.</li>
						<li>Sometimes the cut changes after finishing composing, which can change the tempo of the music so it fits the new length.</li>
						<li>When changing the tempo of the music, need to be careful of the hit points.</li>
						<li>Reaper
							<ul>
								<li>At each marker, able to put a different tempo</li>
								<li>Can do automation tempo map on the master track, tempo can change over time</li>
								<li>View -> Master track -> Trim -> Tick ‘Tempo Map’</li>
								<li>Command + click to add a new point on the automation line</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
                    </ul>

					<h4>John Wick (2017) - Movie trailer</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Very engaging music, pretty different techniques of scoring the actual film and a movie trailer</li>
						<li>The music is really emotional and powerful, fast tempo, heavy layer</li>
						<li>Did not use original music, license the music</li>
						<li>Very popular marketing tools for movie trailers - These tracks do have a highly produced vibe, most of the tracks are audience and able to connect with</li>
						<li>Use these licensed tracks to attract more audience</li>
						<li>Some audiences may go and watch the movie because they love the tracks</li>
						<li>Hiring a composer to do original music is usually much cheaper than paying for these licensed tracks</li>
                    </ul>

					<h4>‘Lost in Stars’ (2023)</h4>
                    <ul>
						<li>Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M517nduQpM</li>
						<li>This is a Chinese Movie that I watched a few months ago. Since I really love the soundtracks, I decided to re-watch it again this week.</li>
						<li>The part that really impresses me is near the end (1:50:55), which makes me shocked at the power of music in a film.</li>
						<li>It is an underwater scene; the composer uses effects to create a spiritual space. All the music sounds like it's coming from underwater.</li>
						<li>Between 1:50:55 - 1:52:20, it has a mixed use of traditional instruments and synchronization. The piano is used to narrate the story and emotions, and synchronization is used to sketch the indistinct feeling and space.</li>
						<li>Between 1:52:25 - 1:53:05, string family and drums are involved. There is no talking at all since both of the characters are under the sea. However, the anxiety and hopelessness emotion all successfully expressed through the music.</li>
                    </ul>

					<h3>Major Project</h3>

					<h4>Mastering</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>I did an overall mastering in this week. I opened up a few music tracks and videos for reference and try to have similar volume level.</li>
						<li>I find out the volume is getting too loud in the ending when both of the music and original sound track stacking together. I choose to add a limiter and compressor for all of the music, original and master track</li>
