                    <h3>Lecture Content and Reflection</h3>

                    <h4>Animation</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Animators need to commit to strict frame counts for the moments of animated characters.</li>
						<li>Usually 24 frames for live-action and 25 for animation</li>
						<li>Change frame rate in Reaper: File -> Project Settings -> Video</li>
						<li>Early animations were aimed at children. Strategic placement of Songs at various intervals of a feature animation would catch and re-engage a younger audience maintaining their attention.</li>
						<li>Simple structure to engage children -> Song, Drama, Song, Drama</li>
                    </ul>

					<h4>Steamboat Willie (1928)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mickey Mousing -> music that is too synced to what’s happening on screen</li>
						<li>There is heavy background music with all the activities happening on the screen that has a sound effect (chimneys, steering wheels, little interaction between characters…).</li>
						<li>Since there is no diagonal in this animation, the only way the audience can understand the story is by image and sound effects. The sound effects here present the storyline very well, but too much sound is stacked on top of each other making the fragment a little bit of disruption.</li>
                    </ul>

					<h4>Snowwhite</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The opening music sets the overall mood. Some romantic string sound provides a dreamy and magical feeling, forcing the audience to quickly get into the story.</li>
						<li>When snow white is standing on the side of the well, she sings out her interior monologue. By demonstrating most of the diagonal in a musical theatre form, it is perfectly harmonious with the background music.</li>
						<li>The prince sings the theme melody that appears before, creating continuity and emphasising the audience they are in the Snow White world.</li>
                    </ul>

					<h4>The Little Mermaid</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be consistent with the sound all the way throughout the film/animation.</li>
						<li>When the mood changes from romantic to nervous, it does not change the overall texture of the music, just the notes immediately getting faster and lower.</li>
						<li>When the shark comes inside, the music gets faster and louder. Although it creates tension, the music still has a bright tone that caters for the kids.</li>
                    </ul>

					<h4>Madagascar</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When the characters communicate, very rare music is playing but when the camera moves to the lively park, heavy music is involved.</li>
						<li>The music goes on and off, but the overall tone doesn’t change a lot.</li>
                    </ul>
